
FCB V0.8.1.1 - File Compare Binary  -  freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de


Usage:

FCB FileSpec1 FileSpec2 [-i]

-i  ignore different file sizes, compare up to smaller size


Samples:

FCB D:\Pictures\Holiday2012\* U:\Holiday2012

FCB big.bin small.bin -i


FCB is a fast replacement for Windows FC.EXE. It supports only the
binary mode of the original.
The original acts often very dull: Comparing large files it allocates
nearly all the free memory. And it reads the files thru the Windows
file cache even if its useless because of the file size.

FCB reads directly from the disk. It uses three separate threads for
reading the two files and for comparing. So FCB is nearly always faster
than FC.EXE. The only exeption is when you compare a file with itself.
FCB then really reads the data twice from disk while FC gets the data
of the second file from the Windows file cache.

The usage is similar to the original but the /B parameter doesn't exist
because FCB only supports the binary mode, processing sub-dirs isn't
implemented yet.
