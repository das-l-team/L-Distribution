This is a win32 utility program. When started from the command line of ReactOS
it will display the time elapsed since last reboot. Here's a sample output:

 "System Up Tme:         0 days, 2 Hours, 34 Minutes, 28 Seconds"
 
This ReactOS utility might also work with Microsoft(TM) OS. But only try at own risk!
