The binary files L1_putty.exe, L2_putty.exe, L3_putty.exe, L4_putty.exe located
inside this folder are binary-identical, name-only-alterations of the official
PuTTY file "puttytel.exe". ("puttytel.exe" is the non-ssh version of the PuTTY
terminal program.)

Besides being exact (i.e. binary-identical) copies of the original PuTTY executables,
the files mentioned above have their file names changed in order to make them easily
identifiable by the Windows taskill utility which will be employed to release an already
assigned serial communications port to the upload program whenever the user hits F10 or F11
key's that trigger uploading of a new program to the target system (e.g. a microcontoller
board attached via the serial communication board.
