  [ Error message ]

  No program could be extracted out of the existing .DAT file and/or could be converted into C-Control/BASIC source code. 

  Frequent causes:
 
 - The selected .DAT file is not on drive L: .
   ( currently conversion can only be transformed when .DAT file is located on drive L: )
 
 - The .DAT file has an incorrect format.  It might be that this .DAT file was generated for another type of application, e.g. a Mediaplayer (The .DAT name extension is not exclusive to C Control applications).  
 
 - However, If you are sure this is the correct .DAT file it might have been accidentially altered, for example, through insertion of keystrokes while the file was opened in an editor or sent as an attachment of an e-mail.
