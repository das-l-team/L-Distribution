[ Regarding this version ]

 Not yet implemented functionality: "Generate assembly output into "raw" file (*.BIN)

 We haven't arrived at a solution for this, yet.

 If you know of a working solution, please help us to improve
 this toolchain by submitting your idea.


The good news:
==============
 
 There is a simple workaround!

 Please click on the tab with the assembly source code again, then
 press the F9 key. This will invoke Frank A. Kingswood's Assembler
 which will then generate the *.BIN file in question.
 
Thanks for your support
