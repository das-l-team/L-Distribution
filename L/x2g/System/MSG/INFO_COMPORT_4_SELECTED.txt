  Known limitations:

- Currently, only COM ports 1,2,3,4 are selectable, even should this computer
  be equipped with additional serial port adapters. Some USB-serial adapters may
  cause inconvenience if they are set to higher port numbers by default
  e.g. COM ports 5..255. Refer to their respective user manual to find
  instructions on how to manually select a port number in the range of 1..4
