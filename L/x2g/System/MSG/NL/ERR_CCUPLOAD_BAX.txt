 [ Error Message ]

 None program could be read back from the target system and/or connversion into C-Control/BASIC  source code (decompiling) was not successful.

   Frequent causes:

- The correct interface is not selected, is not switched on, or is in use
- The target system is not in host mode, or is not switched on
- The target system sends an unknown ID string.  The ID string must be identical to:  

                     CCTRL-BASIC Version 1.1 (20.12.96)

  ( The ID String must then be followed by a Carriage Return (ASCII 13) )


- Reading back bytecode is not supported by the target system.

  Eventually the selection can be enabled, while this error message compiles, is transmitted to the target system, and performs the task there. 


  [ idea: This error message could contain the source code of a utility program, which enables ]
  [ read-back of bytecode from such not yet read-back enabled devices. One could then simply]
  [ compile this actual error message, upload it as a user program to the target system and]
  [ where it would enable read-back functionality]

 PRINT " This would be an example of an utilitiy program that was coded into an error message"
