  This is regarding the status message "Component (name of component) is not available."

  (This is not really an error message)

  Q: Why am I getting this message?

  A: Due to licence concerns some 3rd-party helper programs may not be available from the |_
     installer program. However, there are placeholder directories containing stub
     files for these programs. They prompt the message you'll see when the related
     toolchain is invoked. As an end-user, you may legally retrieve missing 3rd-party
     components and integrate them for your personal use with the |_ Distribution.

  Q: Where can I get and how do I install additional 3rd-party components?
  A: Most missing programs made freely available  by their authors for downloading
     on their respective websites. Most times you'll download a ZIP file containing
     the programs files. Integrating with an already installed |_ Distribution is simple:
     Just unzip them into the matching placeholder directory (see above question).

  Q: Ok, got it! Now, can I build my own personal installer package including them?
  A: Absolutely. Setup script can be found here: "L:\x2g\System\SETUP\L_Installer_Package.iss"
     (Can be compiled with Jordan Russell's free tool 'INNO Setup Compiler')
     With this you can generate a customized installer package in a single executable
     file that you can run and install with on your computer.

      Please make sure to indicate your authorship on any modifications you made to the
      original |_ installer package.

     Also, set a strong password (and keep it safe) If you have included any copyright                restricted 3rd-party software to prevent it from accidentially leaking into the wild.
