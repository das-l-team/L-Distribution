
   This tool allows for burning machine code into certain types
   of 68xxx OTP microcontrollers. Programming a OTP microcontroller
   is much like 'burning' a CD-ROM, i.e. you can render the OTP useless
   if you applied wrong settings or interrupt programming.

    ______________________________ WARNING: ____________________________

    Using this tool may permanently damage or completely disable already
    programmed OTP microcontrollers. Therefore it is highly discouraged
    to use this tool on an already programmed C-Control/BASIC chip!
